### Description

Will Do is a task management application that is designed to help users create S.M.A.R.T goals and tasks.

- **S = Specific**: Your objective (goal/task) should be clearly stated so anyone can read and understand it. They should also be able to infer what will be done and who will do it.
- **M = Measurable**: This is where you would identify how this objective was/will be accomplished. This is normally in terms of quantity, but quality also works.
- **A = Attainable**: Ensure that you have the time, manpower, resources and authority to accomplish the objective.
- **R = Relevant**: The objective should be aligned with your values and long-term goals/aspirations
- **T = Time-based**: Set a realistic, yet ambitious end date to clarify objective priority and increase motivation

The goal of this application is to promote SMART goal setting and help users achieve their desired goals no matter how ambitious they may be.

#### Key Features:

- **Goal Creation:** Users can create a goal by using the SMART acronym. This is the starting block of a users journey for change.

- **Task Creations:** Create tasks that can be stand alone, such as "taking out the trash", to measurables for a goal to keep a user on track to achieving their time goal.

- **Status Tracking:** Goals and Tasks can be tracked via them being open and complete.

- **Urgency Classification:** Tasks are categorized by urgency levels, helping prioritize and address critical tasks promptly.

- **Archiving:** Completed or outdated goals and tasks can be archived for reference, keeping the active goals and tasks list clutter-free. These can still be found using our drop down filters.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both users and technical support staff, ensuring easy navigation and usage.

- **Security and Privacy:** Robust security measures protect sensitive information, ensuring data privacy and compliance with company policies.

By implementing our Will Do: Crush your Goals application, you can streamline your organization of daily tasks and goals as well as your long term ones. Having one place to view and modify these items will see improved performance and percentage of completion of your goals and tasks. It also takes the headache out of having to remember it yourself or where you wrote it down.
